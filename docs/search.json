Before joining SMU, I studied at HaNoi University of science and technology, under supervise of Assoc. Prof. Huỳnh Quyết Thắng. Upcomming PhD Candidate at University of Sydney, working with Dr. Kang Hong Jin.\nI am deeply interested in Software Engineering, particularly Artificial Intelligence for code-related tasks. My research goal is to develop trustworthy AI-based tools with the assistance of domain-specific, code-related knowledge, such as static analysis. This would assist developers in identifying, preventing, and fixing vulnerabilities. I am currently working on several ongoing projects, including developing an AI agent–based vulnerability exploit generator and creating a large benchmark of Java programs to explore how static analyzers can be used in conjunction with Large Language Models."
