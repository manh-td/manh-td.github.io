Hi, I am Duc-Manh Tran (Trần Đức Mạnh).

I am a Research Engineer at Singapore Management University, working in the TITAN project with [Prof. David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/). Before joining SMU, I studied at HaNoi University of science and technology, under supervise of [Assoc. Prof. Huỳnh Quyết Thắng](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/psg-ts-huynh-quyet-thang.html). Upcomming PhD Candidate at University of Sydney, working with [Dr. Kang Hong Jin](https://kanghj.github.io/).



I am deeply interested in Software Engineering, particularly Artificial Intelligence for code-related tasks. My research goal is to develop trustworthy AI-based tools with the assistance of domain-specific, code-related knowledge, such as static analysis. This would assist developers in identifying, preventing, and fixing vulnerabilities. I am currently working on several ongoing projects, including developing an AI agent–based vulnerability exploit generator and creating a large benchmark of Java programs to explore how static analyzers can be used in conjunction with Large Language Models.
